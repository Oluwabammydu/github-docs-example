“Secret Window, Secret Garden”, by Stephen King, is a story about Mort Rainey, a writer accused of plagiarism by John Shooter, a mysterious man from Mississippi. Shooter threatens Mort, and promises to do revenge if he does not get his story back. The story untangles with Mort having startled dreams and conversations with himself. His plan is to prove that the story does not belong to Shooter, however some events will prevent him from doing that. Amy Milner, Mort’s ex-wife, and her current husband, Ted Milner, are also victims and suspects, together with Mort. As the plot changes, with deaths and strange things happening, the existence of Shooter is questioned. The book and the movie have a similar context, although they follow and end with different plots, giving the readers quite a few scenes to be compared.
